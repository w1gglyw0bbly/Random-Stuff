There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems. New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++, or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation. Python is also usable as an extension language for applications written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or automation interfaces.

Python is a great object-oriented, interpreted, and interactive programming language. It is often compared to Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C#, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme or Java.
