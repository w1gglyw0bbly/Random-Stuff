1. What is the function of a vortex generator?:It is designed to delay or prevent separation of the boundary layer.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-13):Chapter 1
2. What are the three axes of an airplane?:Longitudinal, lateral, and vertical.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-23):Chapter 1
3. What are the three primary flight controls of an aircraft?:The ailerons, elevator, and rudder.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-27):Chapter 1
4. Name several secondary flight controls and describe their general purpose?:Secondary flight controls consist of various types to trim tabs such as balance tabs, anti-servo and servo tabs, and spring tabs. Their function is to assist the pilot in moving the controls and to trim the aircraft to fly hands-off.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-31):Chapter 1
5. Name several types of auxiliary flight controls and describe their general purpose?: The auxiliary flight controls consist of the various high-lift devices used during low-speed flight such as leading and trailing edge flaps, slats, slots, speed brakes, etc.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-33):Chapter 1
6. What is a servo trim tab?: It is an auxiliary control, positioned by the movement of a cockpit control and designed to create aerodynamic forces to assist in moving a control surface.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-32):Chapter 1
7. What is a spring tab?: It is an auxiliary control designed to aid the movement of a primary control at high speeds when control forces become too high.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-32):Chapter 1
8. What is a blaance trim tab?: It is an auxiliary control designed to create aerodynamic forces to assist in moving a control surface. The tab is positioned by a control rod connected to the fixed surface on the same side as the horn on the tab.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-32):Chapter 1
9. What are four most common types of high lift devices?: Leading and trailing edge flaps, slats, and slots.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-33):Chapter 1
10. Describe some of the tools used to check control surface travel?: A universal propeller protractor or special control surface protracotor.: (Page Reference: JSAT 1-44):Chapter 1
